    I study at New Dawn Public School. My school is one of the oldest schools of my area. It has a very good and successful history in education. My school is very near to my home. I often to my school on foot but sometimes my father drops me at school while going to his office. My school has a beautiful building with wide open playground and a beautiful garden.

    I reach at my school on time. After taking part in assembly, all the students go into their classrooms. I study in class 2nd. My teacher is very kind and lovely. He teaches us with care and love. My class-fellows are very careful. They all help each other in studies.
    
    My school follows the discipline strictly. Various seminars and events are held in our schools. Students are encouraged to take part in all those events. There is a big auditorium hall in the mid of our school, built for that purpose only. Various programs like quiz competitions, speeches, tabloids, debates, etc are held. Apart from that, the students of my school also take part in other academic and sports competitions against the other schools.
    
    My school values sincerity, honesty, dedication and good manners. It focuses the overall development of students. All the students are treated very kindly. In fact, we all feel this school as we second home. Students of various backgrounds and different ages study here with great mutual cooperation and care.
    
    My school is one of the best schools in terms of educating and training the students with good manners. The schools have really a great role in creating a well behaving and law abiding citizens for country. School are the real training grounds for a nations. I am greatly proud of my school. I am thankful to my parents who chose this finest place for me to study.
